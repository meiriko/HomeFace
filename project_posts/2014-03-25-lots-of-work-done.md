## Yes, we have been silent
We had a very busy few weeks. Discussing the possibilities and looking at the work done so far, coding new directions and testing again. This all happened while doing a huge technological makeover and moving to go (using Googles app engine and the GO language). In the next post we'll tell a little more about what direction we took and finally expose a working version (online!) of the application. I can only say it looks pretty cool.

One of the main things we added is the ability to specify, besides the final mapping, an intermediate transformation. This shows how the basic shapes map to the final naive home. We found this to be more "ecological valid" and to illustrate much better the what the facial features map to the home.

Just as a heads up, here is a series of images that demonstrate the result:
