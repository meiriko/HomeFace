## GAE is a GO!

I (MS) have been silent for a few days. I have been digging deep into GAE and GO as the platform for initial deployment of our system. Those have been very busy days (slowed only by my unpredicted Flu). The GAE engine combined with GO seems like a great platform and after spending my time "on my hands and knees" I got the grip of it and I am moving full speed ahead.
Trying to build a rather complex application to analyze and store images and then to draw naive homes (or other shapes) based on a language we define requires a lot of object linking (a.k.a references). After spending a few hours understanding how to move keys around the system and use them for further queries, things seem to be simple. We believe in a few days our initial prototype will be ready and the HLB can start experimenting with developing the interpretive language. The system will also support a comparison functionality to enable putting interpreted drawings together and see if we manage to produce meaningful, expressive and differentiable results. Don't go nowhere, exciting news are on the way.
