## How unique are we ?

We are all a part of the human race, but is there that special something that makes us us ?

Our face is our identity, it is unique and is our first calling card in social interaction.

Our face is a facade, can a person know who we are just by our facial features ?

For many years I wondered if there is a returning pattern in our facial features. We all have a nose, eyes, mouth, forehead etc. But how many have sharp features ? what percent has a high forehead ?

Can people be classified according to their unique facial features ?

Some of us take our facial features for granted. Yet others try to modify them using different procedures, do to social pressures. Even so, our face is composed of our set of facial elements which makes a one of occurrence, our face.

In my artistic work I look to giving a certain individual stand out of the crowd. Deeply understand the uniqueness of each and every one.

As a multi disciplinary artist, I find my fields of interest broadening continuously. That is why when Meir approached me about a collaboration combining art and code, I was enchanted by the idea.

We met and started brainstorming about the working on a joint project for the DEVART competition. Coding is new to me, i have never known this type of creativity.

During our talks my art work around the house subject was raised. We tried to think how can we transform this idea to something special for each person. Create a new “language” that we can all understand.

We got the idea to try and find each persons unique home.
