## Finding the right tool

Last time I wrote about finding the right lightweight, easy to use, feature extraction library. I mentioned SimpleCV and node-opencv.

Trying both, including installation and configuration was a story in itself. It took a few good hours and lots of [stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) posts and the result was not good enough. Went back to Google, tweaked my search terms and voila! The perfect candidate was found. [Clmtracker](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) by **[Audun Mathias Øygard](https://github.com/auduno)** (thank you Audun!) seems like the right tool for the job. Dealing with image processing for quite a while, I found this library easy to download and install and it does a great job. Not only that it does a good feature extraction, it generates a set of 71 points(!) from a facial image:

![](/project_images/facemodel_numbering_new_small.png)

Such high level tracking with large number of points enables experimenting with the interpretation and transformation of the facial proportions to a naive home drawing.

For the time being, I run the files locally and modify it so that HLB can start a study in the search for the right language and interpretation. Here is a simple example using Audun's own image:

![](/project_images/hf1.jpg)

And two more samples using other images:
![](/project_images/hf2.jpg)
![](/project_images/hf3.jpg)

I chose to use [_NodeJs_](http://nodejs.org/) as the server, for its simplicity and ease of use. To enable quick and easy study by HLB and experimenting with a variety of images, I need to modify the web page so that it can load images from a given url. Since the images can not be read directly, due to [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) limitations, the images can't be loaded directly and have to be piped through the server. To do this, I used NodeJS' [request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) library for streaming.

After a bit of coding, the final result for the NodeJS server file is:

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var requestSVC = require('request');

app.get(/^\/pt\/(.*)/, function(req, res){
	// res.end("Hello, " + req.params[0] + ".");
	var ptUrl = req.params[0]
	if( ptUrl.indexOf('http') !== 0 ) {
		ptUrl = 'http://' + ptUrl;
	}
	// res.end('looking for: ' + ptUrl);
	try {
		requestSVC(ptUrl).pipe(res);
	} catch( e ) {
		console.log( e );
	}
});
app.get('/', function(req, res){
	res.redirect('examples/homeface_tester.html');
});
app.use(express.static(__dirname ));

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

The server is basically a static server with 1 exception, if the user passes a url to '/pt/' (for pass through), the server reads the url (= the image) and pipes it to requesting page. This way the CORS limitation is bypassed for now.

Back to my keyboard.... shhhhh, a coder at work.
