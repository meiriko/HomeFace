## What DevArt did so me (so far)

DevArt seems to evolve into a cross technologies adventure. In the few days and many nights I (MS) ferociously work on coding our art work, I have learned so many new "tricks" :-)
Being [**In The Flow**](http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology.html) (if you have 23 minutes, you better see this video), I don't have much time to share my exciting discoveries so I'll have to be brief - I am coding in [**GO**](http://golang.org/ "golang.org") for[Google's app engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/)! If you told me this a few days ago, I'd go nahhhh, but now it is part of my toolbox. I was lucky to hear about the GO language a few days ago in the [**Reversim Summit**](http://summit2014.reversim.com/agenda) which took place a few days ago in Google's TLV campus. It did seem a little odd at first, but the speaker promised results within an hour and he was right.

So, what do I need it for? As I mentioned, we are building a tool to test our hypothesis and to do that, we need to load images, analyze them and save the results. With go and Google's app engine, this is relatively easy and there is no need to set up a database, connect with it, define a schema etc.

What have we got so far?
1. A page that loads and analyzes images.
2. A set of ([normalized](https://github.com/meiriko/HomeFace/blob/master/project_posts/2014-02-28-normalizing-points-and-future-thoughts.md "link to our previous posts")) points representing facial features and proportions.
3. The ability to save the data for later retrieval.

This is, for the lack of a better expression, way cool. With years of development, it still seems like a magic - designing, coding and deploying such an app in such a short time. We hope we'd be able to show an early working prototype soon.
