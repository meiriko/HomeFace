## About challenges and new frontiers

I (MS)ran across DevArt incidentally but immediately knew I wanted to participate. The nature and subject matter of DevArt seem exciting and promising. I managed to team up with a great artist (HAL) and started working.
It has been less then 2 weeks since we started and I am already grateful for the personal and professional gains form being a DevArt participant. Working as an "industrial coder" for a living I hardly get such opportunities for doing things like I do for DevArt. I managed to do things that would regularly take days in a few hours, cross new borders, learn new technologies (working with github, prose.io, GAE, GO and many more). I had great moment of "flow" where my mind was focused and agile on imagining, thinking, searching, experimenting, learning, designing, implementing, fixing, updating, problem solving, generalizing and again and again (occasionally I noticed I have forgotten to eat, stretch or go to the bathroom).

There is a saying in Hebrew: _**"The road is smarter than those who walk it"**_, and I have a little more than 3 weeks to walk it.

Thank you DevArt :-)
